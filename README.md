# Next Steps:
Future enhancement would include a history of personal attributes as well as the ability to enter in more attributes such as body fat %. Visual representation such as graphs and charts to show progress over time would also be included. 
Other visuals such as goal completion as well as pictures to show the desired exercise would be add to a nice user experience. Finally the application will also have specific workouts and exercises geared towards specific goals.
